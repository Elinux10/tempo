# Notes on math

For max-width, pixel widths divisible by 12
will generally make columns work better at full width

## Recommended max-widths

REM   | Pixels 
----- | ------
75rem | 1200px
60rem | 960px


## Recommended gutter widths and their REM values at max-width 75rem

Percentage | REM
---------- | -------
2%         | 1.5rem
3%         | 2.25rem
4%         | 3rem
